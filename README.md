# spotify-analyzer

This tool is intended for statistics-loving spotify addicts like me.

Upon adding the local file path(s) of your downloaded spotify streaming history to the file_names variable in the run method, some basic statistics will be printed out. Additionaly, a specific day can be specified to review the streaming history and length of that day. 

You can download your personal data here: https://www.spotify.com/de/account/privacy/
Beware: some dates are coded in german format.
Ideas for new features always welcome :)
